## Introduction
QuanSim is a platform of quantum programming. QuanSim是一款量子编程平台，它包含量子仿真器，
## QuanSim
### Architecture

We should point out that "Decohenerce Simulator", "Quantum Program Control-flow" and "Analysis and Verification of Quantum program" are still under development. And we will release them in the future.

### Data Type
There are four kinds of data types in QuanSim: Bit, Qubit, Qubits and Circuit. Bit means one classical bit, and the value of this type is either 0 or 1. Qubit is the most basic type in quantum computing, which can be in 0 and 1 simultaneously. Qubits will be generated when Qubit is entangled with other Qubit. And Circuit is the basic executable unit. Please note that each experiment and each circuit is a one-to-one correspondence.<br/>
The relation of these data types are shown as follow.

### Quantum Gate
For now, the supported quantum gates include: single-qubit gate (that is, H-gate, X-gate, Y-gate, Z-gate, S-gate, T-gate, $S^dagger$-gate and $T^dagger$-gate) and double-qubit gate (that is, CNOT). And it's clearly that the set of these gates are universal. <br/>

## How to Use It
### Start
You can run QuanSim in the following two ways:<br/>
* Pass the function name you want to run to **main.py**. The format of the function name should be **function()**. <br/>
* Run **main.py** without parameter, then QuanSim will give you a list of all available functions. Type the id of the function you want to execute.<br/>

### Design Your Own Code

## Development Plan
We should point out that there are still some features that haven't been developed yet:
* Due to the physical constraints, the QASM code generated by QuanSim  may not be able to execute on IBMqx successfully. We should continue optimizing the code so that it satisfies the requirement.<br/>
* The analysis and verification of quantum program is an urgent requirement. <br/>
* The quantum control-flow is still under development.<br/>
* Some unknown bugs.<br/>
