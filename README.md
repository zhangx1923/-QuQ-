We should point out that "Decohenerce Simulator", "Quantum Program Control-flow" and "Analysis and Verification of Quantum program" are still under development. And we will release them in the future.

### Data Type
There are four kinds of data types in QuanSim: Bit, Qubit, Qubits and Circuit. Bit means one classical bit, and the value of this type is either 0 or 1. Qubit is the most basic type in quantum computing, which can be in 0 and 1 simultaneously. Qubits will be generated when Qubit is entangled with other Qubit. Circuit is the basic executive unit, and each experiment corresponds to one Circuit.<br/>
The relation of these data types are shown as follow.
